## Why Am I Named Alpaka?
The Alpaka ITSM AI System was a project created for the Code; Without Barriers Hackathon.

My creator's chosen problem statement title for the hackathon is "Intelligent Incident Resolution with AI Assistance".

So, in my head the acronym is "IIRewAA".

This, in turn, reminded me of the phrase, "Alpaca iriwa!" which they teach you to say in Alpaca World in South Korea. (My creator is not Korean, she just likes Alpacas.)

Therefore, my creator named me "Alpaka".
